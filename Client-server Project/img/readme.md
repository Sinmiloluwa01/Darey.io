## UNDERSTANDING CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE

Client Server Architecture with MySQL

Client-server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected over a network to send and receive request s between one and another.

In their communication, each machine has its own role : The machine sending the request is referred to as the CLIENT and the machine responding (serving) is referred to as the SERVER.
